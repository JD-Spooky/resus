<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Rapid assessment of sick or injured children is made easier if the relevant guidelines and care pathways are available immediately in digital format.<br/>
<a href="https://www.uhbristol.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/your-hospitals/bristol-royal-hospital-for-children/">Bristol Royal Hospital for Children</a> have pulled together a collection of resources and built them into a powerpoint presentation, available via a desktop shortcut on a PC in the resus room.<br/>
<p>At the hackday, Robin Marlow (robin.marlow@uhbw.nhs.uk) pitched an idea to have the guidance re-built in a web-based format.<br/>
  James Dornan and <a href="https://www.grantforrest.me.uk">Grant Forrest</a> built a small web app with the <a href="https://react.dev/">react</a> framework to present a dashboard of resources, pulling data in from a library of markdown files and deployed to <a href="https://jd-spooky.github.io/resus/">github pages</a>.</p>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>The app is built using <a href="https://react.dev">react.dev</a>. To download and run locally, follow this handy guide:<br/>

<p>Using node package manager (npm) you are free to build and re-deploy the app.</p>
